# About SmartShop
SmartShop is a home inventory management system created by a group of engineers in a senior design group at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). The design was created over the Fall 2016 - Spring 2017 academic period. The application uses Android Studio with Java to create an Android app to interact with the SmartShop system.

SmartShop is a system composed of a Raspberry Pi 3 with a 7" touch screen, two wireless barcode scanners, along with a smartphone app that allows users to scan items in/out of a system that keeps track of what inventory is on hand. It is primarily geared towards grocery items in a household but could be expanded to a broader scope such as parts management at small companies.
